### 시각장애인들의 여행 정보격차 해소를 위한 서비스, Amby

## Project Introduction
### What's the Problem?
Travel information is plentiful, but it is often too “big” and “visually centric” for people with visual impairments.

### What’s the Goal?
We provide review summaries, audio guides and disability information to help visually impaired people plan their own trips and reduce barriers to accessing information easily.
